Liquidity is important and I want to help.

This image has common commands you'll need to run makerdao keepers.

You'll need a running parity node (for now on kovan testnet) with rpc open to the keepers, but NOT to the internet. This RPC will have unlocked funds and so MUST be protected!

You'll need several accounts and they will need to be unlocked. I need to write more about how many you'll need and how to fund them and HOW TO BACK THEM UP!!!

I need to connect consul/vault here so we do secrets right. don't just put things in env vars once we are on mainnet!
consul will also make it simple to build reserved_peers lists

My setup looks like: [p2p network] <-> [geth] <-> [parity] <-> [lots of keepers]

Because of how I installed the various makerdao app's into their own environments, you'll need the makerdao-helper script to get them on the path.
